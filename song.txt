sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
i send a postcard 
send to you
Did it go through?
Sendin' all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life
Every night
Givin' all my love to you

My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honour you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
